 **Important** 
    — Requires VS Code 1.26+ (the current insiders builds)
    — As of now, it uses the vscode built-in imports organiser. Support for third party organisers might be a new feature.
    — Not compatible with "Pair Brackets Colorizer" Extension, disable and re-enable before and after action execution.

## Supported languages

- VS Code's built-in JavaScript and Typescript support.
